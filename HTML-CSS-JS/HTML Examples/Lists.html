	<h1>Lists in HTML</h1>
	<p>Lists are of 3 types in HTML 5. They are:
	<ul>
	<li> ordered List</li><li> UnOrdered List</li><li>Description List</li>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Ordered List</h2>
	<p>When U wish to list a group of items in a definite order like numberings, charecters, they they are created using a tag &lt;ol&gt;. Every List Item is placed under the tag &lt;li&gt; Both li and ol are paired Tags. U could use an attribute type to define how the numbering should happen. It could be any of the following values:
		<ol type="a">
			<li>1</li>
			<li>I</li>
			<li>i</li>
			<li>a</li>
			<li>A</li>
		</ol>
	<hr/>
	<h2>UnOrdered List</h2>
	<p>When U wish to list a group of items in an indefinite order without any numberings, charecters, they they are created using a tag &lt;ul&gt;. Instead of numberings, U will have bullets placed to identify the list item. Every List Item is placed under the tag &lt;li&gt; Rest of the features are similart to Ordered List. U could use an attribute type to define the shape of the bullet. It could be any of the following values:
		<ul type="disc">
			<li>disc</li>
			<li>circle</li>
			<li>square</li>
			<li>none</li>
		</ul>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Description Lists</h2>
	<p>HTML has a new style called Description List  or Simply Definition List that will hold entries listed like a Dictionary. The Definition List is good way to present a list of tems and its terminologies. The Definition will be provided by a tag called &lt;dt&gt; and the details of it will be placed under &lt;dd&gt; Tag.
