<h1>Tables in HTML</h1>
<p>Presenting the data in the form of Rows and Columns is what makes Tables. Used to display tabular data like List of Employees, Customers, Billings etc. 
	Starts with a table Tag, followed by each row represented as tr tag. Each tr will have either a td(TableData) or a th(TableHeader). Every td and tr has to have an ending tag. <br/>
	Many a time, the presentation of the data into a Table would be dynamic which is done using any scripting language. 
	<h2>A Simple table with static data</h2>
	<table border="1">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th colspan="4">List of Employees with Us</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Employee ID</th>
				<th>Employee Name</th>

				<th>Employee Salary</th>
			</tr>
