18.You develop a Windows-based application that enables to enter product sales. You add a subroutine named TestKing. You discover that TestKing sometimes raises an IOException during execution. To address this problem you create two additional subroutines named LogError and CleanUp. These subroutines are governed by the following rules: 
LogError must be called only when TestKing raises an exception. 
CleanUp must be called whenever TestKing is complete. 
You must ensure that your application adheres to these rules. Which code segment should you use?
a)	try { TestKing(); LogError(); } catch (Exception e) { CleanUp(e); }
b)	try { TestKing(); } catch (Exception e) { LogError(e); CleanUp(); } 
c)	try { TestKing(); } catch (Exception e) { LogError(e); } finally { CleanUp(); } 
d)	try { TestKing(); } catch (Exception e) { CleanUp(e); } finally { LogError(); }
